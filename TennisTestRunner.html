  <h1>Rules of the exercise:</h1>
  <p>Pretend your company is tasked with writting a simple Tennis scoring function.  Your coworker was working on this job but is out sick.  You'll need to step up so you can meet the deadline.
  Your boss tells you that they have captured all the requirements for the job in the unit tests.  You can look at the TennisTest.js file but can't change it.  What you need to do is complete the TennisGame.js script that your coworker has started.  You'll know you are done when all the tests pass.
 Additionally your boss gives you the original requirements from the client.  This functionality is already capture in the tests, but might be helpful.
  Here are the clients requirements:
  <ul>The games are scored starting at zero or "love".  The first point is called 15, then 30, then 40, then game point, which wins the game</ul>
  <ul>If the players have the same score but less than three points each, it is the name of the point plus "all".  Example "fifteen all".</ul>
<ul>A player must be two points ahead in order to win the game.</ul>
<ul>If each player has won at least three points, and their score is the same, it is described as "deuce".</ul>
<ul>If each player has won at least three points, and one players is one score ahead, it is described as "advantage".</ul>
